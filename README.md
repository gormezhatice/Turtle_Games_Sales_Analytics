# Project Background: Enhancing Sales Performance through Data Analysis at Turtle Games
Turtle Games boasts a diverse product range, including books, board games, video games, and toys, both self-manufactured and sourced from other companies. The company, aiming to enhance overall sales performance by tapping into customer trends, approached us with specific queries.

The investigation delved into understanding how customers accumulate loyalty points, identifying groups within the customer base for targeted marketing, leveraging social data such as customer reviews for informed marketing campaigns, assessing the impact of each product on sales, evaluating data reliability through measures like normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis, and exploring potential relationships between North American, European, and global sales.

The project unfolds as a strategic pursuit to unravel key insights that will empower Turtle Games in refining their marketing strategies and boosting overall sales performance.
