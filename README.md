# My-bio
I completed my education in International Trade and obtained an MBA in International Marketing from Coventry University London. I am actively seeking permanent full-time positions to advance my career in Data Analytics. In my current role, I consistently perform well under pressure, successfully managing multiple deadlines and projects. 
I have made significant progress in my professional journey by enrolling in the Data Analytics Career Accelerator course at LSE. Throughout the first module, I developed my abilities in Excel, Tableau, and SQL. Moving forward, I am eager to maintain the same level of dedication in the second course and expand my knowledge in Python.
